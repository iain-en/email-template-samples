# EN Email Template Samples

Resources for creating our default sample HTML templates. Building samples from common elements in the "includes" folder means we don't have to update individual samples every time we tweak something.

Grunt script processes HTML files in "src", inserting included HTML elements from the "includes" folder and places output in "build". The contents of "build" can then be uploaded as email samples.

Email samples must be sent using the CSS inliner!


## Samples:
en_master.html:
A master template containing the basic header and wrapping HTML for our templates to use as the starting point for all samples. Also contains example HTML email elements e.g. hero images, editable text, article rows "all-in-one". Generate samples from the HTML in this document and also use it to test structural / header / CSS changes before rolling out to other samples.
